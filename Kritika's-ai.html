		<h2>Artificial Intelligence by Kritika's group.</h2>
		<p>Artificial intelligence, sometimes known as AI, is a type of intelligence that differs from natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. It is shown by machines. Artificial intelligence is fast evolving, from ALEXA to self-driving cars. It has the ability to predict when and where disasters are likely to occur with greater accuracy, and who knows, maybe AI could also help cure cancer. Experts are using artificial intelligence to build solutions that help prevent innocent people from violent acts and it can also help improve education for students. So all in all, artificial intelligence is a technology that can potentially change the world.</p>
