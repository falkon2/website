		<h2>Blogging</h2>
		<p>A blog is a website or a section of a website with regularly updated information on one or more topics. The phrase is short for "web log," which refers to the act of logging information on a website.Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that's self-published online.Â Sinasta Meitei is a student of class 4-D who was inspired by her dad to make a website and hence, she started making blogs on food to entertain her viewers. A food blog is a website made by the creator talking about their own experiences with food. A food blogger can range from a professional chef to someone who's doing it just for their own benefit, just like Sinasta. 
Going to her website, we can see all about the different kinds of food she eats on a specific day. From sampling tea to eating pani - puri, we can find all kinds of food content in Sinasta's blog channel.</p>
